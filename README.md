This repository contains public data corresponding to the manuscript
titled "Quantum Chemical Insight into Electrochemical Upgrading of
Bio-oil"

## Preferred Configurations

This folder contains *.xyz files of the preferred adsorption configurations of the species on each facet and the relaxed bulk slab.

## FF_on_Pt111_Ex_Calcs

This folder contains two notebooks describing the analysis of a FF on Pt(111) structure relaxation and vibrational analysis. Input and output files are in data/QE_files.

## Free Energy Diagrams

The notebook PES.ipynb produces the free energy diagrams in Figure 3.

## Potential Dependence

This folder contains two notebooks (FF_PDG.ipynb and 4PP_PDG.ipynb) detailing the calculation of potential dependent state energies for FF and 4-PP pathways provided in Figure 4.
The calculation of limiting potentials for each pathway on the 4 facets is provided in Limiting_Potential.ipynb
